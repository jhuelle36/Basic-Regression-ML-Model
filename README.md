# Basic-Regression-ML-Model
This code contains multiple regression models which are trained to be able to predict a car's MPG. These models include single-variable linear regression, multiple-variable linear regression, single-variable deep neural network regression, and multiple-variable deep neural network regression.  All models contain some form of a normalization layer. This project aimed to compare different Mean Absolute Errors between the four models to measure efficiency. Measured the efficiency by graphing the loss of each model and by displaying MAEs as the model's trained epochs. In conclusion, the single-variable linear regression model had the highest MPG and the multiple-variable Deep Neural Network had the least. I learned how to make this model using TensorFlow tutorials.
