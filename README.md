# Basic-Regression-ML-Model
This code contains multiple regression models which are trained to be able to predict a car's MPG. These models include single-variable linear regression, multiple-variable linear regression, single-variable deep neural network regression, and multiple-variable deep neural network regression.  All models contain some form of a normalization layer. I learned how to make this model using TensorFlow tutorials.
